Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   10
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:            69 out of   4,896    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               354 out of   4,896    7%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            208 out of   2,448    8%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     208 out of     208 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     208   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         406 out of   4,896    8%
    Number used as logic:               178
    Number used as a route-thru:         52
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     176
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of RAMB16s:                      1 out of      12    8%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.52

Peak Memory Usage:  315 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  20 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   20 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

   (max. 5 shown):
   textDrawComponent/Mram_textMemory86/SPO,

INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
